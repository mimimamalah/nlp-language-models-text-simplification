All the information on how to read, implement and submit your assignment is explained in detail below.\n","\n","1. For this assignment, you will need to implement and fill in the missing code snippets for both the **Jupyter Notebook** `assignment1.ipynb` and the `data.py` and `modeling.py` python files. In the `data.py` and `modeling.py` files, you will add all the Dataset and Model classes you will implement according to the skeleton present in the files. In the notebook, you will use the definitions from those python files to prepare datasets, train and finetune models and add the report at the end.\n","\n","2. To implement your coding part, you can import the external libraries we provide in the `requirements.txt` file, however, you should not use any other package not included in these requirements. We recommend using **python=3.10** for this assignment\n","\n","3. At the end of the notebook, you will need to fill in a **report** template, providing the results of your implementation. We provide you with the template for the report, therefore you need to fill in the missing Markdown cells with the requested information.\n","\n","4. Along with the `assignment1.ipynb` and the `data.py`, `modeling.py` files, you need to additionally upload model files under the `models/` dir, regarding the following models:\n","    - the two LSTM-variant models (PART 2)  \n","    - the trained-from-scratch DistilGPT2 model (PART 2)\n","    - the fine-tuned Encoder-Decoder model (PART 3)\n","    - the fine-tuned T5 model (PART 3)\n","    \n","You will provide test results on all of the model variants according to the report template.\n","\n","5. Finally, you will need to log your training pipelines using Tensorboard. Please follow the instructions in the `README.md` of the [tensorboard/](tensorboard/README.md) directory.\n","</div>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"-Zxf_xaAlHjl"},"outputs":[],"source":["# This cell makes sure modules are auto-loaded when you change external

model of a sequence of tokens.\n","\n","🔵 **What?**\n","\n","Language modeling (LM) is the use of various statistical and probabilistic techniques to determine the probability of a given sequence of words occurring in a sentence. Language models analyze bodies of text data to provide a basis for their word predictions. They are used in natural language processing (NLP) applications, particularly ones that generate text as an output. Some of these applications include, machine translation and question-answering.\n","\n","🟡 **How?**\n","\n","There are several different probabilistic approaches to modeling language, which vary depending on the purpose of the language model. From a technical perspective, the various types differ by the amount of text data they analyze and the math they use to analyze it (architecture). Some LMs we've already seen and will learn about during lectures are n-gram / count-based models, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformer models.\n","\n","🟣 **Why?**\n","\n","Language modeling is crucial in modern NLP applications. It is the reason that machines can understand qualitative information. Each language model type, in one way or another, turns qualitative information into quantitative information. This allows people to communicate with machines as they do with each other to a limited extent. It is used directly in a variety of industries including tech, finance, healthcare, transportation, legal, military and government.

One reason would be that the scratch model has learned more effectively from the specific training dataset provided, leading to better generalization on the test set.\n","\n","Also having a test loss lower than the training loss can be explained due to data leakage between the train and test data because in this assignment we didn't perform any checks to make sure texts came from different articles in Wikipedia. (From Ed)\n","\n","Concerning the training efficiency, it took both of them approximately 20 minutes to run with 9.20 iterations per second which looks decent.\n","\n","Thus there is not much difference in training effienciy, one reason is that the computational cost of other layers (such as LSTM or linear layers) dominates. Indeed, my initial belief was that the computational cost of the embedding layer will be reduced compared to training embeddings from scratch because there are no updates to compute during backpropagation.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ieaNrQIJzow-"},"source":["<a id=\"22\"></a>\n","## 🎯 Q2.2: **Train a Transformer: DistillGPT2**.\n","\n","\n","<div style=\"padding:15px 15px 15px 15px;border-left:3px solid #03befc;background-color:#eff7fe;border-radius: 15px;color:#424242;\">\n","\n","**We train a DistillGPT2 on our train/test dataLoaders:**\n","\n","- **Step 1**: Rebuild the datasets and dataloaders using huggingface tokenizer;\n","\n","- **Step 2**: Train a DistilGPT2 efficiently using Trainer form `transformers`.\n","\n","- **Step 3**: Evaluate perplexity scores on `test_dataloader`.\n","\n","**TODO🔻: follow the instructions below**.\n","</div>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"jUWqgNzvzoj-"},"outputs":[],"source":["from transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModelWithLMHead, AutoTokenizer, DataCollatorForLanguageModeling, Trainer, TrainingArguments\n","\n","model_name = \"distilgpt2\"\n","tokenizer_checkpoint = \"distilgpt2\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":231,"referenced_widgets":["4f85624885d0466d8e81064d14f7c686","fa9fa0cce0bd4c6ea1bd395cc4d00183","d7070f8050e747009d9d7e4ccae1447c","5394987e8ded49dd82df8ec04fcfc857","a896ab10f704456884893edd31815045","742d6978fda34dd89b37e9903d5e60d5","6e98c77efc18456ebefc134252800fbe","69401f69798647e292d63abda511803b","53e7272af2bc407cbfc0c0b3656fa303","d1be97731cbc40bda689ce19f18145b4","ea72e928ee944d1fbddc0872a397f9dd","53901240aa2f4df08ecdbd28dabc8324","ff53780f1ac846ebbdb78863503f6df6","8d8f5a8acbca486694179ac3304eab95","54cd08c20f0640978cda22d7bdd5f6db","8932e6ab03904da7bd7d4d919ad09dd6","320c19c0a60c4f0f8f3a95d1073413ac","8ce985e056094745a406a629d7b2f250","3b79eb00c5474b5bb9340cb33cc25b9a","307fb2fcb584435eb470d3c98deccfde","300a1daaa9d9478ba630efa4441817bb","97193e86c0664c94869d509d10c32e9e","f7b2b236dee8441ba1b10f6093c8a8f4","3c72f9658dd74bd39660a6584be1a782","8553f6408c93408b86e4ab46aa749fc0","887047088264491cb982a1427e344359","cb6e82f711624f4eac7d446a9afb350a","8f81491a686240c7844fcd00de86f12c","1ab5d08487734f7da3666032cdf31aba","61829ba3004e45938d9dfda1ef14937e","f7614aef37bd449e8708667178155bac","905dfc3536dd43c09d596e6d0bcec7a3","5f8e2655026047a0b28079979713fdd5","58c63e5567094e7e9fcb4ea436364c60","2c3b5a34d7fc4e88ba51cb8dee132752","91aee89c1f714d9eac8c866abebe994d","6f677e8315d34d428f16ec0560b4b017","a8772cdd71a849f996a493fff41bc742","64b6f0ea6f1a427bbdd9d2f849d67e9f","95fcc19f24ba46e9be5edbed4060b58e","6e416875edb24fc79896e36145740204","ebc59132284b4269957d4d4790fe40c0","f4ad5be49e9e49c78aee44897b0e1c0f","d7c6a53d4dda419990f6b2e20f6b0d1c","b3ea3925e23b4e89a18b87cbf5b3bdb6","f195b81eb7244fb6ace0ad9949687bde","85f729a1f4de4fdc8e630ef9403b71c4","672499cfc527411882524c3647a00c52","bc33cf7652a84e1f853d887e0766d70c","b5f30f5d49064c028a77bba9b747af0d","f1f33d4997444a41aed39fa6d1d3cf20","b95a49e330ae4d30a1615751b7b4fa03","38f66736e8724c6bbc89219de1adf46c","95dc6c35b739454cbcd8cbbe5c1a9be2","12ba332e19db4c17a2b7b26045e678b2"]},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7884,"status":"ok","timestamp":1710527081972,"user":{"displayName":"Malak Lahlou","userId":"06427181277494045962"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"QLaG6iasiTAd","outputId":"b6236a1f-6169-451e-e920-019a9ddce0a5"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"4f85624885d0466d8e81064d14f7c686","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["config.json:   0%|          | 0.00/762 [00:00<?, ?B/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/transformers/models/auto/modeling_auto.py:1571: FutureWarning: The class `AutoModelWithLMHead` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
